we have to make local repository on our local system which is a copy of centrl repo. and 

steps to make local repository:
1.initialize(git init)
2.add file(git add .)
3.commit(git commit -m "first commit") wher m is our message.in this step we get an error then 
we get 2 lines where we write our email and username.after that again we commit it to successfully exit.

4.remote repo add
5.push this on to the cloud(after this we login by github account) an check our github account
